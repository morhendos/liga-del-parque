- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: 4 columns
- Smooth transitions between breakpoints

### 2. **Touch-Friendly Interactions**
- Tap-to-activate cards on mobile instead of hover
- Visual feedback on tap with scale transform
- Minimum tap target size of 44px (accessibility standard)
- Removed hover effects on touch devices

### 3. **Optimized Typography**
- **Title**: 
  - Mobile: 1.875rem (30px)
  - Tablet: 2.25rem (36px)
  - Desktop: 3.75rem (60px)
- **Subtitle**: 
  - Mobile: 1rem (16px)
  - Tablet: 1.125rem (18px)
  - Desktop: 1.25rem (20px)
- Improved line height for better readability

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
- Simplified animations on mobile
- Reduced backdrop blur intensity (10px vs 20px)
- Lighter gradient overlays
- Hardware acceleration with transform3d
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion

### 5. **Enhanced Visual Design**
- Smaller icon containers on mobile (56px vs 80px)
- Responsive border radius (rounded-2xl on mobile)
- Optimized shadows for mobile displays
- Maintained brand colors while improving contrast

### 6. **Accessibility Features**

- Proper ARIA labels (to be added)
- High contrast text
- Scalable font sizes

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update FeaturesSection.js
Replace the existing component with the mobile-optimized version:

```javascript
// Copy the entire mobile-optimized FeaturesSection component
// from the artifact above
```

### Step 2: Add Mobile CSS to globals.css
Add the mobile-specific CSS optimizations to your `app/globals.css` file:

```css
// Copy all the CSS from the mobile-css-additions artifact
// Add it at the end of your globals.css file
```

### Step 3: Test on Multiple Devices
Test the implementation on:
- iPhone SE (375px width)
- iPhone 12/13 (390px width)
- iPhone 14 Pro Max (430px width)
- iPad Mini (768px width)
- iPad Pro (1024px width)

### Step 4: Performance Testing
Use Chrome DevTools to:
1. Test with CPU throttling (4x slowdown)
2. Check paint flashing
3. Monitor FPS during animations
4. Test with slow 3G network

## Mobile-Specific Features

### 1. **Tap Interaction State**
```javascript
const [activeCard, setActiveCard] = useState(null)
```
Tracks which card is active on mobile for visual feedback.

### 2. **Conditional Styling**
```javascript
${isActive ? 'shadow-xl transform -translate-y-1' : 'shadow-md'}
```
Applies different styles based on tap state on mobile.

### 3. **Swipe Hint**
```html
<p className="md:hidden text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-6">
  Tap on cards to explore features
</p>
```
Guides mobile users on how to interact with cards.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
